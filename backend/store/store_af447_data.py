On 1 June 2009, Air France Flight 447 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after entering an aerodynamic stall triggered by iced pitot tubes and pilot mismanagement, killing all 228 onboard. Primary cause: an unrecovered stall due to pilot error following unreliable airspeed indications. Key factors: pitot tube icing (loss of airspeed data), inappropriate crew inputs, failure to follow stall procedure, and lack of timely stall recovery."
