By reacting instantly to the stall warning and correcting the flight path (something a human missed due to distraction/fatigue), the AI system might have prevented the stall and crash.",

On February 12, 2009, this Newark-to-Buffalo flight entered an aerodynamic stall on approach and crashed into a house in Clarence Center, killing all 49 onboard (and one on the ground). Primary cause: the captain's incorrect response to the stall warning (improper recovery input). Key factors: inadequate airspeed monitoring, breach of sterile cockpit discipline, poor cockpit management by the captain, and insufficient training/procedures for flight in icing conditions."
