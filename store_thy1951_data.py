    "passengers": 128,
    "fatalities": 9,
    "survivors": 126,
    "primary_cause": "A faulty radio altimeter reading triggered the autothrottle to cut engine power to idle, and the crew failed to notice in time to recover, resulting in an aerodynamic stall on approach.",
    "key_factors": [
        "Faulty left radio altimeter gave an incorrect low altitude indication",
        "Autothrottle reduced thrust to idle based on the false altitude data",
        "High pilot workload and inattention to airspeed (glide slope intercept from above) delayed the crew's response",

    ],
    "how_ai_copilot_could_help": "An AI-powered co-pilot could cross-check multiple sensor inputs (such as dual altimeters) to detect anomalies and prevent automated systems from relying on a single faulty reading. It would also monitor airspeed and flight path, alerting the crew to an impending stall or even taking corrective action (like adding thrust or initiating a go-around) if the pilots fail to respond in time, thereby helping to avoid or mitigate this kind of accident.",
    "embedding_summary": "Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, 2009-02-25, near Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam, Netherlands ‚Äì stalled and crashed on approach due to a faulty radio altimeter and pilot error. Primary cause: the faulty altimeter triggered idle engine thrust and the crew reacted too late to prevent a stall. Key factors: faulty altimeter; autothrottle cut power; crew not monitoring airspeed; high workload and improper stall recovery."
